    <string name="football_workouts_description">
        Here are our recommendations for a full week of football workouts. If you decide to include all of these workouts into your weekly
        regimen we recommend that you intersperse your days off throughout the week to give yourself time to rest in-between these difficult exercises.
        If you are feeling as though you could push yourself even further after having tried a week on this plan, we recommend you spend one of your rest days
        in the gym focusing on steady state cardio for 30-60 minutes.
